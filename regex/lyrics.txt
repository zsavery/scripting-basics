Demon next to me
Could you ever tell me why
Every time I try to move just like you
I fall behind?
Demon next to me
Tell me, can I touch the sky?
If I have the power to keep up with you
I will try, and

If I touch the sun on a summer day
Will a chain of lightning strike me down?
What will be found
On the hard ground?
If I fail again, again
And I
If I touch the sun on a summer day
Will a chain of lighting strike me down?
Before I hear the sound

Demon next to me
Can I make it through another year?
Sometimеs it seems to be so hopeless
This cross, I havе to
Demon next to me
Tell me brother can you hear
Whispers in the wind again?
Tender eyes of demons

I touch the sun on a summer day
But a chain of lightning strikes me down
And while I'm down
On the cold ground
As I fail again, again
And I
I touch the sun on a summer day
But a chain of lightning strikes me down
Before I hear the sound

Open your eyes
And take a look around
You won't find what you're looking for
Only what needs to be found

Well, the summer
The summer
The summer lightning's over
Will you be here when it's over?
Well, the summer
The summer
The summer lightning's over
Yeah, I'll be here when it's over
The dream again

I touch the sun on a summer day
If a chain of lightning strikes me down
I won't be found
On the cold ground
I won't fail again, again
And I
I won't touch the sun on a summer day
As a chain of lightning strikes you down
Before you hear the sound, ydemon next to me

every time i try to move just like you
i fall behind

demon next to me
