# sh-basics

Welcome to the **sh-basics** repository! This resource is designed for students who are learning shell scripting. It contains a variety of simple and practical examples, exercises, and mini-projects to help you master the basics of Bash and shell scripting.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to provide hands-on practice with essential shell scripting concepts. By exploring and running these scripts, you will learn how to:

- Work with variables, input/output, and arguments
- Use loops and conditionals
- Manipulate files and directories
- Apply regular expressions
- Build and run scripts for real-world tasks

## Folder Overview

Each folder focuses on a specific topic or skill:

- **arguments/**: (empty) Placeholder for future exercises about passing arguments to scripts.
- **arrays/**: Learn how to use arrays in Bash with `names.bash`.
- **conditionals/**: Practice decision-making in scripts (`fruit.bash`, `max_value.bash`, `max_value.sh`).
- **input/**: Discover how to read input from users and files (`1_from_user.sh`, `2_from_file.sh`, `input.txt`).
- **loops/**: Explore different loop types (`for_loops.sh`, `until_loop.sh`, `while_loops.sh`).
- **output/**: See how to print output, use variables, and write to files (`1_echo.sh`, `2_variable.sh`, `3_to_file.sh`, `4_append_to_file.sh`, `output_1.txt`, `output_2.txt`).
- **regex/**: Use regular expressions for searching and matching text (`lyrics.txt`, `word.bash`).
- **variables/**: Understand variable usage in Bash (`city.bash`).

## Sprint 1 Final

- **sprint_1_final/**: Contains a final project and example script for review (`Lab8Example.txt`, `script.bash`).

## Sprint 1 Review

Practice scripts and mini-projects for review and self-assessment:

- **sprint_1_review/1/**: Hello world and functions (`hello_func.bash`, `hello_world.bash`)
- **sprint_1_review/2/**: Counting and searching in files (`count_fruit.bash`, `find_peter_pan.bash`)
- **sprint_1_review/3/**: More file operations and reading (`find_peter_pan.bash`, `pan.md`, `read_file.bash`)
- **sprint_1_review/4/**: Writing to files (`write_to_file.bash`)
- **sprint_1_review/5/**: Creating files (`create_file.bash`)
- **sprint_1_review/6/**: Coin counting example (`coins.txt`, `count_coins.bash`)
- **sprint_1_review/7/**: Final review script (`final.bash`)

## Getting Started

1. Browse the folders and pick a script to study or run.
2. Open a terminal in this directory.
3. Run scripts with `bash <scriptname>` or make them executable with `chmod +x <scriptname>` and run with `./<scriptname>`.
4. Try editing scripts and experiment with your own changes!

## New Coders

- Each script is commented to help you understand what it does.
- Try to predict the output before running each script.
- Modify scripts to test your understanding.
- Use these examples as a starting point for your own shell projects.
